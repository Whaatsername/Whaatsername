## Unreal Engine C++ Pro Course

In 2020 I taught a full curriculum at Stanford University for Unreal Engine C++. You can now enroll in this course yourself using the links below.

The C++ Course features include building of a C++ game framework including an "action system" and event-driven code for flexible and re-usable game code the "unreal way". Multiplayer features, AI bots, SaveGame system, async loading of content, UMG menus and UI and so much more!
